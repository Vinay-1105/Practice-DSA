Given the `head` of a linked list, return _the node where the cycle begins. If there is no cycle, return _`null`.

There is a cycle in a linked list if there is some node in the list that can be reached again by continuously following the `next` pointer. Internally, `pos` is used to denote the index of the node that tail's `next` pointer is connected to (**0-indexed**). It is `-1` if there is no cycle. **Note that** `pos` **is not passed as a parameter**.

**Do not modify** the linked list.

 

**Example 1:**

```
Input: head = [3,2,0,-4], pos = 1
Output: tail connects to node index 1
Explanation: There is a cycle in the linked list, where tail connects to the second node.
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: head = [1,2], pos = 0
Output: tail connects to node index 0
Explanation: There is a cycle in the linked list, where tail connects to the first node.
```

**Example 3:**

```
Input: head = [1], pos = -1
Output: no cycle
Explanation: There is no cycle in the linked list.
```

 

**Constraints:**

	- The number of the nodes in the list is in the range `[0, 104]`.

	- `-105 <= Node.val <= 105`

	- `pos` is `-1` or a **valid index** in the linked-list.

 

**Follow up:** Can you solve it using `O(1)` (i.e. constant) memory?
